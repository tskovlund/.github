# Contributing to tskovlund projects

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers the shared workflow
across all tskovlund repositories.

## Code standards

Follow the code standards in [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) — code quality,
testing, commit conventions, and language-specific rules are all defined there.

## PR process

All contributions go through pull requests — **do not push directly to `main`**
on structural changes.

1. Fork or create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure all checks pass (lint, format, typecheck, test)
4. Push and create a pull request
5. CI must pass
6. A maintainer will review your PR — address any feedback
7. The maintainer merges once approved

## Repo-specific details

Each repository may have additional contributing details in its own
`CONTRIBUTING.md` or `AGENTS.md`. Check those for dev setup, commands, and
repo-specific conventions.
